This machine is defective and has been turned into a half-top out of spite. the display is still good and i plan to eventually make a custom monitor out of it.
the laptop could not play a game for several minutes without the whole system locking up, glitching out, shutting off randomly, or literally all 3 things combined.
i tried throwing Windows Embedded Standard 7 onto it because why the hell not. and failed. even Arch Linux could not save this pc. 
this machine is the reason i got the Framework Laptop
